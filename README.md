# Text Uploader

https://text.0x978.com/

A text uploader that allows for the quick upload of text on the fly using ShareX.

Pastes can then be viewed when the user wishes, as well as the ability to sort them into groups, give them titles or edit them.

I originally made this just to host my own pastes privately but decided to add auth and make it public.

## Features:
- Id Uploading via ShareX or manual upload
- Sorting of pastes via groups
- Ability to name pastes
- Ability to edit / delete pastes after upload
- Pastes can be shared via URL

## Technologies used
The stack I used for this project was the T3 stack, this included:

- Next.js
- NextAuth.js
- Prisma
- Tailwind CSS
- tRPC
- Planetscale for database hosting
